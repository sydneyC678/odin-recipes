# odin-recipes
Hello,
This first project creates a basic web page, in which the user can ineractively click on which recipe they would like to view.
When they click on a certain recipe from the homepage, they are redirected to a different page of the site that displays
the recipe description, including images, using basic html concepts and elements.
